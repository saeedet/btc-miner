# Contributing

Thanks for looking. This project is as much for reading as for running, so
clear code and honest explanations matter as much as features.

## Building and testing

You need an Apple Silicon Mac and [Rust](https://rustup.rs). Everything CI
checks can be run locally:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked --release
```

The dashboard and setup screens have snapshot tests: each screen is drawn at a
fixed size and compared, as text, with a file under `snapshots/`. After a
deliberate change to a screen, accept it with

```bash
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p btc-miner
```

and review the changed files before committing them.

## Trying changes safely

Regtest is a private chain on your own machine, where blocks take a handful of
hashes. It needs no download and touches nothing real:

```bash
btc-miner --network regtest
```

On regtest roughly half of all hashes meet the target, so a block being
accepted proves little — a miner computing the wrong hash entirely still gets
blocks in. What proves the code right is the node's stored hash matching the
miner's, block by block.

## Code

- **Small files, one job each,** documented at the top with what they do and
  why. Every public item has a doc comment; the build warns otherwise.
- **Comments explain why,** not what. If a value was measured or read out of the
  node's source, say where.
- **Everything Bitcoin-specific is written here.** Dependencies are for generic
  jobs that teach nothing about mining — JSON, argument parsing, drawing the
  terminal. Please open an issue before adding one.
- **macOS assumptions live in `crates/cli/src/platform.rs`,** so a port to
  another system has one file to fill in.

### Shared with bip110-miner

[bip110-miner](https://github.com/saeedet/bip110-miner) shares most of the command:
the `events` crate is identical, and `dashboard/` and `setup/` match file for
file. What differs between the chains lives in `chain.rs` and
`setup/install.rs`. A change to the shared parts should go to both projects.

## Commits

One logical change per commit, with a subject in the imperative ("Fix…",
"Add…") and a body that says why. Formatting changes go in their own commit.
