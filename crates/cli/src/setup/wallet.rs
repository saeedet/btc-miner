//! A new wallet on the node, protected by a passphrase, with a backup.
//!
//! # The two things that make this safe
//!
//! The passphrase is typed into this program, shown only as dots, and sent
//! straight to the node over its local RPC connection. It is never displayed,
//! written to a file, logged, or put on a command line where other programs
//! or the shell's history could see it.
//!
//! The wallet loads every time the node starts. A wallet left closed stops
//! following the chain, and on a pruned node it can fall so far behind that
//! the blocks it would need to catch up are gone — after which the node will
//! not open it at all without re-downloading the whole chain.
