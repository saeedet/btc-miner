//! Setup: making sure everything mining needs is in place, and asking about
//! whatever isn't.
//!
//! Runs before mining whenever the program is in a terminal. Each step checks
//! first and asks only if something is missing, so a machine that is already
//! set up goes straight to the dashboard, and one where something changed —
//! the node needs updating, say — is asked about that alone.
//!
//! The steps, in order:
//!
//! 1. **This computer** — what it is, and whether the disk has room.
//! 2. **Node software** — installed and new enough, or offered.
//! 3. **Reward address** — set and valid, or asked for. Asked before the
//!    blockchain on purpose: the sync can take hours, and a newcomer should
//!    be able to answer everything and then walk away.
//! 4. **Blockchain** — caught up, or followed until it is, with a quick start
//!    offered where one exists.
