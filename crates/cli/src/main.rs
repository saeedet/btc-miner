//! `btc-miner` — solo-mine Bitcoin from this machine.
//!
//! One command. Run it with nothing after it to mine: it starts the node if
//! needed, then the pool and the miner, and stops them on Ctrl-C. The other
//! commands look things up or change settings.
//!
//! Honest version up front: a found block is a lottery win, not a paycheck.
