//! Deciding whether a node is actually fit to mine on.
//!
//! # Why `initialblockdownload` is not enough
//!
//! Bitcoin Core's `IsInitialBlockDownload()` **latches**. Once it goes false it
//! never returns true again for the life of that process:
//!
//! ```text
//! if (m_cached_finished_ibd.load(...)) return false;   // never re-evaluated
//! ```
//!
//! So a node that syncs to the tip and then loses every peer — a laptop that
//! slept, changed networks, or landed behind a firewall — reports
//! `initialblockdownload: false` **for ever**, with a tip frozen hours or days
//! in the past. `headers == blocks` does not help either: both are frozen at
//! the same stale value.
//!
//! Every check we had passed in that state, and mining in it is not merely
//! unlucky — it is *certain* to be wasted, because the block would build on a
//! parent the network moved past long ago.
//!
//! # What actually catches it
//!
//! **Peer count.** A node with no peers cannot learn of a new block by any
//! means, so zero is unambiguous and cannot false-positive. This is the strong
//! signal.
//!
//! **Tip age**, as a backstop for the case where peers exist but are not
//! delivering. This one needs a generous threshold, for two reasons: block
//! intervals are Poisson, so long gaps happen legitimately, and block
//! timestamps are not monotonic and may sit up to two hours in the future. At
//! three hours the chance of a false alarm is `e^-18`, about one in 67 million,
//! which is comfortably rarer than a wrong system clock.
