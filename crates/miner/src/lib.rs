//! A Stratum V1 mining client.
//!
//! Connects to a pool, subscribes, and hashes whatever it is sent. It knows
//! nothing about blocks, transactions, or the node — only how to turn a job
//! into headers and report the ones that meet the target.
//!
//! That ignorance is the point. Everything this program does, an ASIC also
//! does, and it speaks the same protocol on the same port. Replacing it with a
//! Bitaxe means pointing that device at the pool and stopping this process.
//!
//! # A library, so a dashboard can drive it
//!
//! [`run`] is the whole miner. It reports through a [`Sink`] rather than the
//! terminal, never ends the process, and takes a [`Controls`] handle that can
//! stop it, pause it, or change how many cores it uses while it runs.
